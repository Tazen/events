Chatlogs
Suno shouts: The crimes that I have witnessed committed on behalf of the new Imperial Warden are disgusting. Not only
has she caused, by my own eyes, the permanent death of a follower of Laanx, but she has also imprisoned and cut out
the tongue of Kaerli Stronwylle, the subjugated leader of the Rangers of Yliakum that I knew in Hydlaa during my prime,
that she wishes to give this house to as if to say that it is anymore separate from the growing, corrupt Empire!

Evirea eyes the audience, and then raises her voice. "I can attest that what Suno claimed of Kaerli Stronwylle is true.
She was captured by the Empire and held against her will. I looked for her upon hearing she was missing, and when
finally I found her, she informed me that she had been released only because she bowed to Seria. It was implied that she
would have been killed if she had not. Furthermore...according to Seria's claims, yes, she has been working to take out
the necromancer. But her methods are in question. She sent Lace there, and if I were to hazzard a guess, Kaerli, to act
as his slaves and spies. But we could all agree as to the lack of safety in this method. They could easily die. I doubt
she cares. Furthermore, she's been seen openly conspiring with a well known violent thug, Zerxzz, in a tavern. When
pressed, she insisted it was for orphanage charity."
Evirea shouts: "Lace's testimony is not to be bourne. The man is unright in the head. Recently kidnapped and taken,"
she raises her arm and points to Kisoji, "By this menki here, and dragged to the sewers, Seria was seen following them.
I questioned him about it. Seria claims to have been present, but Lace himself only testifies to the fact that a hooded
figure was there, and only watched as he was tortured."

Hangatyr turns at Rheos "Now get me straight here, first they wanted a concert hall, now a hospital as a donation to the
public, threatning the Royal House with war if they don't comply. Further it is not the Empire who speaks, but the
Tyndale clan, or isn't it?"


Plot
The setup is fairly simple, the prosecution (accusers) give evidence and testimony, they may call witnesses. Then it's
the turn of the defence, they have the chance yo refute or disprove any accusations and also offer any evidence,
witnesses or alabies to exonorate themselfs. A judgement will then be made by an official figure (Amidison) and a
sentence handed down if a conviction is recorded. If proven innocent then the defendant is released imm

TODO before
someone needs to speak to Seria and find out: If he/she is going to need a lawyer, Time/date, then we can book it and
get it out the way.
Sending summons out.

	Seria  - ?
	Suno   - ?
	Kaerli - ?

	Nedes  - Any night after 20:00 GMT preferably Saturday

======== Overview and direction of event =========



Amidison, the witnesses and the lawyers will all enter the courthouse and wait as players file-in.
Once everone has been seated, the guard(s) will instruct the players to remain silent throughout the
proceedings, and that any disruption wil result in ejection from the room.

Then once the time is right, the defendant (Seria) will be lead in, and seated.

Amidison will read Seria the charges and ask how she wished to pleade, guilt, or not guilty.

### THE TRIAL BEGINS ###

IF PLEADS GUILTY:

Should Seria elect to please guilty to the charges presented against her, then the prosecution stage
will be skipped and a direct finding of 'guilty' will be returned by Amidison.
A short break will be called for Amidison to discuss and seek advice/decide on an appropriate sentence.


IF PLEASE NOT-GUILTY:

The prosecution will now be directed by Amidison to call witnesses, give edidence and make their case.
The defence may object as nessesary to the conduct of the prosection and Amidision will direct.
The prosecution may also reserve the right to call the accused (Seria) for questioning, although she--
id not required to incriminate herself, again... Amidison can direct here and maintain conduct.

Once the defence has presented their case and rests, it's the chance of the defence to refute the claims
against them, they may call their own witnesses, cross-examine the prosecutions witnesses and also provide
explanations and testimony of their own.
Once both sides have rested, Amidison will take a short break to discuss and decide on her verdict.


### VERDICT AND SENTENCING ###

Order wil be called in the court and the verdict read-out by Amidison, if found not guilty, the defendant will be released immediatly with the courts thanks.

If found guilty then the decided sentence will be handed down and carried out.
