Plot:
            A guard is dispatched to gather a posse of the finest and fittest in the land to take this chest. It has been reported that the chest is being transported through the Gugrontid area. A guide accompanies the guard to lead the possee and confirm the capture was sucessful.

            The posse set off to locate the chest by way of BD1 and locate the mage coming through the canyon from Gugrotid. The posse set upon this mage and divest him of the chest. The posse return the chest to Hydlaa and present it to the guard.
            
            The guard takes the chest away and returns to reward the Posse.



Rewards:
            (A magic related item seems appropriate. What about a Staff Taz?)
