'In the weak light of the torches emerged an enormous Ulbernaut. Not a regular, but a strange, muscular, white one. As I thought about the wonders of this discovery a white light appeared. A powrerful spell flew toward this special Ulbernaut.A flash of a magic-shield illuminated the room.'


Opening:
The Archmages hear talk of a magical item of such power as to be able to ward off the strongest attack from beyond the Bronze Doors, be it physical or magical in nature. Having sent their agents throughout the dome to gather information they have discovered that not only is the item in Yliakum, but is being transported by couriers. It is contained in a chest protected by a band of cutthroats and a powerful mage.

The Archmages send word to the Vegesimi that this chest must be taken at all costs for the safety of the all Yliakum. The y warn that should this item, a magical shield, be lost we will be in the gravest danger yet.

A guard is dispatched to gather a posse of the finest and fittest in the land to take this chest. Upon gaining this chest the parts are to be assembled in order to use it in defence of the dome.
